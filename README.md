# ATOC-4900-Anemometer-Project
Data Analysis done on Chinook Winds in Boulder, CO w/ Dr. Christine Shields (NCAR), and Aneesh Subramanian (Faculty at CU Boulder in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department)

This project will be in collaboration with scientists at NCAR and the host at NCAR for this appointment will be Dr. Christine Shields. During the appointment, there will collaboration with Dr. Shields and various members of the CCR Section at NCAR on analysis of anemometer data collected at the Mesa Lab over the past year. A timeseries analysis of the anemometer wind data obtained at NCAR will be performed and physical links between the wind variability over the past few decades at NCAR and the largescale changes in winds will be studied.
